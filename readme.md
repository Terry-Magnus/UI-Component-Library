# UI COMPONENT LIBRARY.
- This repo is just a place i get to store reusable code i create in different projects.
- In order not to repeat myself, i simply copy/paste the code.....😁
- You may notice that some components use material ui, chakra, bootstrap, tailwind etc. Don't panic, i use these libraries alot that's why.
- Feel free to contribute or extend as you like😉
- I intend on adding function as well but for now, i'll stick to UI components.
